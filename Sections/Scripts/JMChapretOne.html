                    <b>Chapter One. Wake up Johnny.</b>
                    Johnny woke up earlier than usual. "I haven't slept much, but I can't toss and turn in bed anymore", Johnny thought. There was no need to wake up so early. After all, the man had been laid off from his job a month before.
                    He went to the window and stared out at the deserted street. The sun was breaking through the thick fog. Watching the silence of the small town, Johnny suddenly had the urge to do some great deed. To fill his life with meaning and emotion. He often felt this desire, but it never went beyond a little reflection. He dreamed of what he would like to change in himself and his life. And then he sighed loudly and longingly.
                    As usual, the man began his morning hygiene routine, which he never missed. "Discipline is my strongest quality" he always told himself. While brushing his teeth, he looked at himself in the mirror, thinking if there was anything he wanted to change about his appearance. "It would be nice to add a few centimeters to my height. And with a thick beard my face would be much more masculine, or at least a more masculine chin. And as for my eyes, I've always been fascinated by people with blue eyes, and my gray ones seem to bring boredom to those around me. Also it didn't hurt to gain some muscle, on those branches instead of arms. But I can't stand those jocks, with their proteins and lectures about nutrition. But all in all, I look okay, I don't look like a Hollywood star, but I can't complain too much."
                    Johnny was slowly getting dressed, trying to find a single pair of matching socks. In the end, he had to put on a different pair of gray socks. He put on a pair of casual jeans, a hoodie, and a baseball cap. He got on the bus and went to his parents' suburban house. Public transportation has been a pleasure for him, so he had little desire to buy his own car. When he listened to his favorite music on his headphones, it was like being in a music clip, where the houses and people whizzing by outside the window seemed like scenery.
                    For the past six months, Johnny had seldom visited this house. Every time he'd come here, he'd been devastated inside and his chest had been chained. Ever since his parents died, he needed to get the house ready to sell. And then to pay off his debts, but all this required an enormous effort on his part. Today, when the man woke up this morning, he felt energy inside him. It was as if it had been building up over the past few years and was waiting to break free. He decided to channel that energy into fixing up his house, and he started with the hard part.
                    When he finally finished cleaning out the garage, his eyes stared at the bike. He'd bought it in his second year of college. Johnny remembered, "Oh, I bought it with the idea of camping in the Spruce Preserve, but I didn't have enough money for a tent that summer. My dad helped me with a summer part-time job. How I miss him." He rolled the almost-new bike out into the yard and dusted it off. Then he sat down on the bench in front of the bike and thought about the many things he wanted to accomplish but never did. "And how I wanted to be a train driver. The profession has a lot of disadvantages, but I still think that driving a train through endless forests is great. It is certainly more pleasant than my former work in the office, with endless fixing of reports, maybe it's for the best that I was downsized. I've never been skydiving. I don't speak French at all. I didn't even get to the next town on my bike, and that was the first long ride I had planned, only 20 kilometers." For five seconds Johnny thought about nothing, as if he were immersed in meditation. Then a furious rush overtook him. "Why the hell does everything happen this way?" He exclaimed. The energized man clumsily climbed onto the bike and rode forward. Muttering under his breath, "I'm going to get to this damn town, and the first thing I'm going to do is admire Rose Street like I wanted to fifteen years ago." Johnny's parents' house was on a hill, so he accelerated to high speed. The wind rippled his clothes and hair. An emotion of childlike joy gleamed in his eyes. The fog had cleared, everything was in favor of this little journey. But really, underneath the little journey was the first step into faraway places and the depths of himself.
