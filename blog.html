        	<p class="ptext">Well I celebrated New Year. This new year was more interesting than the past.<br>
The holiday was full of different emotions. I and my girlfriend celebrated with my family, then we went to the central Christmas tree to see the fireworks. And at the end we went to a big hill and watched the lights of the night city and fireworks in different parts of the city. It was very beautiful. I'm glad how I spent my new year.<br>
Of course, I want to sum up the results of 2017 and tell about goals for current year. Last year, I could not fulfill many the goals, because I was too ambitious. It's sad, but I'm glad that I still have good achievements.<br>
Last year I worked a lot and diligently. This allowed me to become more independent.<br>
I could better to understand myself about what I want to do in life.<br>
And I found a cool girl with whom we build relationships.<br>
I am grateful to her, because she always makes me happy. I am also grateful to my family and friends for everything.<br>
I very like her and I believe that we can develop our relationship and ourselves together.<br>
This year I will study English, developing intelligence and body.<br>
Therefore, I wish everyone more productivity and a happy New Year!</p>
